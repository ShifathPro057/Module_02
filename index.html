    <p>A <strong>Paragraph</strong> is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and <b>thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points</b>. Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long <a href="https://www.freepik.com/vectors/illustrations" target="_blank">illustration</a> of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence. </p>
